# randomPerson
Expo app for fetching random people with login validations and automated tests

Steps to use the project

Note: If you have not installed expo cli on your pc, please install it first by running 'sudo npm install --global expo-cli'. If you had problems in installing, please follow expo documentation.[https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/]

1. git clone the project
2. Install dependencies by running 'yarn install'.
3. run the bundler with command 'expo start'.
4. Type w to open web version of the project.
5. Run automated tests by running 'yarn run test'.


Notice:

1. The project will not work on android and ios for the moment because react native does not allow some line breaks in android and ios.
   A lot of line breaks were used in this project for code readability.
2. Web version will be responsive for 400px screen width and higher.
3. Device.jsx is for later use of the project when I develop android and ios versions.
